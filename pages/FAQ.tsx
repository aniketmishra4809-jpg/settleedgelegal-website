      q: "Is loan settlement legal in India?",
      a: "Yes, loan settlement is a valid commercial resolution between a borrower and a lender. It is an internal policy decision taken by banks/NBFCs to resolve bad debt. SettleEdge Legal provides consultancy to ensure your case is presented professionally within these frameworks."
    },
    {
      q: "Does settlement suit everyone?",
      a: "No. Settlement is a resolution path typically recommended for those in documented financial hardship. It has a significant impact on your credit history (marking it as 'Settled'), which may affect future credit eligibility for a period of time."

    {
      q: "Are resolution outcomes guaranteed?",
